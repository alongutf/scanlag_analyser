"""Footprint colony tracker: each colony keeps its own pixels, also after it merges.

Colonies don't move and only grow, so a colony is followed by its footprint (its pixels in the
previous frame) rather than by a single seed pixel. Per frame, each detected blob is matched to
the colonies whose previous footprint it overlaps:

* none: a new colony, if the blob has at least ``min_area`` pixels (seed = its rounded centroid,
  as in the seed tracker)
* one: the whole blob belongs to that colony. Several blobs may belong to one colony (the
  detector broke it into fragments); they are all its pixels
* several (a merge): the blob is split between them. Each colony keeps the blob pixels it owned
  in the previous frame, and every new pixel goes to the nearest colony front (watershed on the
  distance to the previous footprints, inside the blob). Two neighbours grow by about the same
  step between scans, so this boundary follows the line where their fronts met, and it is
  carried forward frame by frame.

A colony owns a blob if the blob covers its seed pixel or at least ``min_overlap`` of the
colony's previous footprint. A one-pixel overlap from alignment jitter thus doesn't count as a
merge. A blob that overlaps colonies only below that fraction goes to the one it overlaps most,
so a fragment never starts a new colony.

A colony that is already touching a neighbour in the first frame it is detected can't be
separated: it is absorbed into the neighbour (the neighbour's track usually gets a "jump" flag).
